              <p class="meta">Czech Technical University, Prague (Czech Republic) - 2025-2026</p>
              <p>I'm currently completing this Master’s degree in parallel with my engineering program at ENSTA Bretagne, where my coursework spans <strong>Thermodynamics, Dynamics of Solids, Electrotechnics and Sustainable Mobility</strong>. Through this dual curriculum, I’ve developed a strong multidisciplinary foundation in automotive systems, supported by hands-on experience in simulation, control strategy development, and mechanical design. My cursus there includes the following themes:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Theory of internal combustion engine and thermodynamics, modeling of ICE behavior using the GT-suite using 0D/1D/3D models (1-zone, 2-zones and multizones).</li>

              <h3>Preparatory Classes - PSI</h3>
              <p class="meta">Lycée Naval, Brest (France) - 2021-2023</p>
              <p>During my Preparatory Classes PSI at the Lycée Naval — a <strong>French military</strong>-affiliated school — I completed an intensive scientific and technical curriculum that strengthened my foundations in <strong>mathematics, physics, litterature and engineering</strong>. This period allowed me to gain my first hands-on experience with Python, MATLAB, and SolidWorks, culminating in a <strong>numerical simulation</strong> project modeling fire propagation in confined environments. Beyond academics, the military environment played a central role in shaping my mindset: through demanding collective activities, I developed strong <strong>teamwork and leadership</strong> abilities, and cultivated essential qualities such as perseverance, rigor, resilience, and decisiveness — values that continue to guide me in my engineering work.</p>

            <p>
              The cradle is the structural component connecting the chassis to the artillery barrel on the CAESAR self-propelled gun. This project was carried out by a two-student team under the guidance of engineers from KNDS (Nexter). Our primary challenge was the accurate modelling of welded joints subjected to dynamic and multi-directional loading. Because several aspects of the system are confidential, only a redacted version of the report can be shown.
