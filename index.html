            <p class="meta">University project · ENSTA 2025 · Abaqus, Catia, Python</p>
            <p>
              The cradle is the structural component connecting the chassis to the artillery barrel on the CAESAR self-propelled gun. This project was carried out by a two-student team under the guidance of engineers from KNDS (Nexter). Our primary challenge was the accurate modelling of welded joints subjected to dynamic and multi-directional loading. Because several aspects of the system are confidential, only a redacted version of the report can be shown.

          <h3>Turbomachinery Intern – Laboratory for Internal Combustion Engine and Electromobility</h3>
          <p class="meta">Ljubljana, Slovenia · May 2025 – August 2025</p>
          <p>
            This internship involved the design and implementation of experimental setups for aerospace applications. I developed a fully operational test bench for a Garrett GTCP85-98D Auxiliary Power Unit and designed a large-scale Bunsen burner for research applications. The experience reinforced my skills in prototyping, troubleshooting, safety management, and dynamic system integration.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed and built a complete control panel for a Garrett GTCP85-98D turbogenerator, integrating power electronics, wiring, switchgear, and safety systems within a team of three researchers.</li>
            <li>Performed thermodynamic assessments to evaluate the feasibility of indoor APU operation and exhaust evacuation.</li>
            <li>Diagnosed and resolved fuel-system and communication issues affecting APU startup and stability.</li>
            <li>Executed outdoor test campaigns to validate the APU’s operational behaviour and the control panel architecture.</li>
            <li>Assisted in the dimensional sizing of a large-scale Bunsen burner intended for OH and CH radical measurements.</li>
